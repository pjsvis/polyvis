# Task: Prepare for Initial Public Commit

**Objective:** Finalize the project's foundational structure, documentation, and data-handling strategy to ensure a clean, professional, and secure initial commit to version control. The primary goal is to protect the intellectual property contained in the source `cda` and `cl` files while providing a fully functional public demonstration.

## Key Actions Checklist:

- [x] Configure Prettier (`.prettierrc`).
- [x] Populate `AGENTS.md` with core operational protocols.
- [x] Populate `_CURRENT_TASK.md` with the current objective.
- [ ] Create JSON Schemas for `CDA` and `CL` data structures in a new `schemas/` directory.
- [ ] Add a `README.md` to the `schemas/` directory explaining their purpose.
- [ ] Create safe, public `*.example.json` data files that conform to the new schemas.
- [ ] Run Prettier to format the entire codebase before the initial commit.
