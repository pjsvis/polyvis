# Polyvis: A Neuro-Symbolic Graph Visualizer

Polyvis is a lightweight, frontend-only web application for exploring and visualizing neuro-symbolic knowledge graphs. It renders conceptual relationships from a pre-built SQLite database, allowing users to navigate a "Neuro-Map" of interconnected ideas, principles, and directives.

The application is built with HTML, CSS, and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), and uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its JavaScript runtime and toolkit. The graph visualization is powered by [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js) and [Sigma.js](https://www.sigmajs.org/), and the in-browser database is handled by [sql.js](https://sql.js.org/).

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Visualization:** Explore the knowledge graph by searching for terms.
- **Data-Driven Suggestions:** The search box provides a curated list of high-value terms guaranteed to produce rich, interesting graphs.
- **In-Browser Database:** The entire graph dataset is loaded into the browser via sql.js, requiring no active backend server for querying.
- **Alpine.js Reactivity:** Uses [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for a lightweight, reactive UI without a complex build step.
- **Alpine.js Reactivity:** Uses [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for a lightweight, reactive UI without a complex build step.
- **Zero-Build Frontend:** Built with vanilla web technologies and Alpine.js for maximum simplicity and performance.
- **Themable UI:** All design tokens (colors, dimensions) are centralized in `src/css/layers/theme.css` ("The Control Panel") for easy customization.
- **Semantic Styling:** No magic numbers. All styles use semantic variables (e.g., `--surface-panel`, `--border-base`) for consistent theming.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun.js](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (v1.0 or later)
- A local web server for development (e.g., `npm install -g live-server`)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Installation

There are no external dependencies to install for the application itself, as it relies on vanilla JavaScript and CDN-hosted libraries.

### 2. Development Workflow

For detailed instructions on CSS development, database building, and running the app, please refer to the **[Development Workflow Playbook](playbooks/development-workflow-playbook.md)**.

**Quick Start:**
1.  **Dev Mode:** `bun run dev` (Starts server & CSS watcher)
2.  **Build DB:** `bun run scripts/build_db.ts`
