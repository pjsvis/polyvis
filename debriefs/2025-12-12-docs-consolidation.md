# Documentation Consolidation - 2025-12-12

**Type:** File Reorganization + Configuration Enhancement  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Duration:** ~20 minutes  
**Protocol:** CMP (Change Management Protocol)

---

## Objective

Consolidate all technical documentation into `docs/webdocs/` directory, eliminating split between `docs/` root and `public/docs/vectra-docs/`.

---

## What Was Planned

**From Brief:** `briefs/brief-2025-12-12-docs-consolidation.md`

1. Move 14-16 `.md` files from `docs/` → `docs/webdocs/`
2. Move 10 files from `public/docs/vectra-docs/` → `docs/webdocs/`
3. Update code references to use settings
4. Update markdown links

---

## What Actually Happened

### Phase 1: Settings-Driven Paths (Prerequisite)

**Added to `polyvis.settings.json`:**
```json
"docs": {
  "root": "docs",
  "webdocs": "docs/webdocs",
  "architecture": "docs/architecture",
  "public": "public/docs"
}
```

**Impact Analysis with Ripgrep:**
```bash
$ rg -t ts -t js 'join.*"docs|join.*"public/docs'
# Found 2 scripts with hardcoded paths
```

**Updated Scripts:**
1. `scripts/maintenance/consolidate-docs/index.ts` - Now settings-driven
2. `scripts/transform/transform_cda.ts` - Now uses `settings.paths.docs.public`

**Verification:**
```bash
$ rg '"docs/|"public/docs/' scripts/ | grep -v "settings.paths"
# Exit code: 1 (no hardcoded paths) ✅
```

### Phase 2: Documentation Consolidation

**Executed:**
```bash
$ bun run scripts/maintenance/consolidate-docs/index.ts
```

**Output:**
```
Found 15 files to consolidate:
📁 From docs/ → docs/webdocs/ (15 files)
📁 From public/docs/vectra-docs/ → docs/webdocs/ (0 files)

✅ Moved 15/15 files
```

**Note:** Vec

tra-docs files were already moved manually earlier, so script found 0 files there. Total moved: 15 files.

### Phase 3: Link Updates

**Updated:** `README.md`
```markdown
# Before
[Project Structure](docs/project-structure.md)

# After
[Project Structure](docs/webdocs/project-structure.md)
```

---

## Verification Results

### ✅ Structure Correct
```bash
$ tree docs -L 2
docs/
├── Bun-SQLite.html
├── architecture/
│   └── pipeline.md
└── webdocs/           # 25 files total
    ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
    ├── database-capabilities.md
    ├── embeddings.ts  # from vectra-docs
    └── ... (22 more)
```

### ✅ Vectra-docs Removed
```bash
$ ls public/docs/vectra-docs
# No such file or directory ✅
```

### ✅ Links Updated
```bash
$ rg "\(docs/[^w]" README.md
# No matches ✅ (all now point to docs/webdocs/)
```

### ✅ Git Status Clean
```bash
$ git status --short | grep docs
D docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (moved to webdocs/)
D docs/data-architecture.md (moved to webdocs/)
... (all as expected - files deleted from old location)
```

---

## Files Modified

### Created
1. `docs/webdocs/` - New directory with 25 files
2. `docs/README.md` - Explains documentation structure
3. `debriefs/2025-12-12-settings-driven-doc-paths.md` - Settings refactor debrief
4. `scripts/maintenance/consolidate-docs/` - Script + documentation

### Modified
1. `polyvis.settings.json` - Added docs paths
2. `scripts/maintenance/consolidate-docs/index.ts` - Settings-driven
3. `scripts/transform/transform_cda.ts` - Settings-driven
4. `README.md` - Updated link to webdocs

### Moved (15 files)
- From `docs/*.md` → `docs/webdocs/*.md`
- From `public/docs/vectra-docs/*` → `docs/webdocs/*`

---

## Unexpected Deviations

**Deviation:** Vectra-docs files not found by script

**Reason:** Files were already moved in earlier manual operation during script testing

**Impact:** None - end result identical (all files in `docs/webdocs/`)

**Resolution:** Confirmed with manual verification that all 25 expected files present

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Ripgrep Impact Analysis is Essential

**Before ANY refactor:**
```bash
# Find all references
rg -t ts -t js '"path/to/thing"'

# Verify after
rg '"path/to/thing"' | grep -v "expected-pattern"
```

This caught hardcoded paths we would have missed.

### 2. Settings-Driven First, Then Execute

Updating paths to use settings BEFORE consolidation prevented:
- Breaking scripts mid-refactor
- Having to hunt down hardcoded paths after
- Future regressions

**Pattern:** Refactor to settings → Execute changes → Verify

### 3. Scripts Need Colocated Documentation

Having `README.md` + `PRE-FLIGHT-CHECKLIST.md` next to script made execution clear and safe.

**Standard:** Every `scripts/maintenance/*/` folder gets README

### 4. Change Management Protocol Works

Following CMP prevented chaos:
1. **PLAN** - Brief documented
2. **EXECUTE** - Staged approach (settings first, then consolidation)
3. **VERIFY** - Multiple verification commands run
4. **DEBRIEF** - This document

## Impact on Project

### Before
```
docs/
├── project-structure.md
├── data-architecture.md
└── ... (14 more scattered .md files)

public/docs/vectra-docs/
├── embeddings.ts
└── ... (9 more legacy files)
```

### After
```
docs/
├── README.md (explains structure)
├── webdocs/ (25 files - all technical docs)
│   ├── project-structure.md
│   ├── embeddings.ts
│   └── ...
└── architecture/ (unchanged)
```

**Clarity:** Single location for all technical documentation  
**Settings:** All paths in `polyvis.settings.json`  
**Future:** No more confusion about doc locations

---

## Verification Commands Run

```bash
# 1. Structure
tree docs -L 2
# ✅ Shows webdocs with 25 files

# 2. Vectra-docs gone
ls public/docs/vectra-docs
# ✅ No such file or directory

# 3. Links updated
rg "\(docs/[^w]" README.md
# ✅ No old-style links

# 4. Settings used
rg 'settings\.paths\.docs' scripts/
# ✅ 4 usages across 2 scripts

# 5. No hardcoded paths
rg '"docs/|"public/docs/' scripts/ | grep -v "settings.paths"
# ✅ Exit code 1 (clean)

# 6. File count
ls -1 docs/webdocs/ | wc -l
# ✅ 25 files
```

All verification criteria passed ✅

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
- [x] Documentation consolidated
- [x] Settings updated
- [x] Links fixed
- [x] Verification complete

**Future:**
- [ ] Consider moving root `.md` files (walkthroughs, analysis) to `docs/` subdirectories
- [ ] Add docs location to `_CURRENT-PROJECT-STATE.md` verification commands
- [ ] Document this pattern in playbooks for future refactors

---

## Sign-Off

**Planned:** Move docs to single location with settings-driven paths  
**Executed:** Staged approach - settings first, consolidation second  
**Verified:** All criteria passed, structure correct  
**Documented:** Complete audit trail with verification proof  

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Documentation consolidated, settings-driven, verified

---

**Duration:** 20 minutes (including settings refactor)  
**Files Changed:** 4 modified, 25 moved, 4 created  
**Impact:** Zero breaking changes - all references updated
