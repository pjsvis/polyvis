# Debrief: Sigma Zoom Implementation

**Date**: 2025-11-21
**Topic**: Implementing Zoom Controls for Sigma.js v2.4.0

## Accomplishments
- Successfully refactored documentation, moving tech stack details to `bun-playbook.md` and `web-standards-playbook.md`.
- Implemented functional "Zoom In", "Zoom Out", and "Reset Zoom" controls for the Neuro-Map.
- Successfully disabled mouse scroll wheel zoom to prevent interference with page scrolling.
- Created `playbooks/sigma-playbook.md` to document Sigma.js v2.4.0 usage.

## Problems
- **Version Confusion**: Initial implementation assumed generic Sigma.js behavior without verifying the specific version (v2.4.0), leading to incorrect assumptions about settings (e.g., `mouseWheelEnabled`).
- **Zoom Direction**: The "Zoom Out" button initially zoomed in because Sigma v2's `camera.ratio` is the inverse of magnification (larger ratio = smaller view/zoomed out), which was counter-intuitive.
- **Scroll Disabling**: Standard settings found in search results (`zoomOnWheel`) were not effective for v2.4.0. We had to resort to a DOM-level event capture solution.

## Lessons Learned
- **Verify Version First**: Always check `package.json` or the library source to confirm the exact version before implementing features, especially for libraries with major breaking changes like Sigma.js (v1 vs v2 vs v3).
- **Inverse Ratios**: In Sigma v2, `camera.ratio` represents the "view size", not the "zoom level".
    - `ratio < 1` = Zoomed In
    - `ratio > 1` = Zoomed Out
- **Event Propagation**: When library settings fail to disable interactions (like scroll zoom), standard DOM event propagation control (`e.stopPropagation()` in the capture phase) is a reliable fallback.
- **Explicit Logic**: Using `camera.animate({ ratio: ... })` with explicit calculations is more deterministic and easier to debug than helper methods like `animatedZoom` when behavior is unclear.
