# Debriefs Playbook

## Purpose
A debrief is a retrospective document created after the completion of a significant task or milestone. It captures what was done, what went wrong, and what was learned to improve future work.

## File Naming
- **Drafting:** You may create `DEBRIEF.md` in the project root for visibility during the session.
- **Final Location:** `debriefs/` directory
- **Final Name:** `YYYY-MM-DD-[slug].md` (e.g., `debriefs/2025-11-25-sidebar-refinements.md`)
- **Requirement:** You **must** move the draft to the final location before finishing the session.

## Template

```markdown
---
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]

## Best Practices
- **Be honest:** Documenting failures is as important as documenting successes.
- **Be specific:** Avoid vague statements. Reference specific files or code patterns.
- **Update Playbooks:** If a lesson learned implies a change in process, update the relevant playbook immediately.

## Post-Debrief Checklist
- [ ] **Archive Brief:** Move the completed brief from `briefs/` to `briefs/archive/`.
- [ ] **Update Current Task:** Update `_CURRENT_TASK.md` to reflect the completion of the current objective and readiness for the next.
