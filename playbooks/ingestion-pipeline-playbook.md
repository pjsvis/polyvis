# Ingestion Pipeline Playbook

## Overview
This playbook documents the architecture, operation, and debugging of the Polyvis Ingestion Pipelines (`PERSONA` and `EXPERIENCE`).

## Architectue: Two Pipelines, One Lake
We utilize a "Context Lake" architecture where distinct pipelines ingest data into a shared SQLite database (`resonance.db`), separated by the `domain` field.

### 1. PERSONA Pipeline
- **Source:** `scripts/fixtures/cda-ref-v63.json` (CDA), `conceptual-lexicon-ref-v1.79.json` (Lexicon).
- **Transformation:** `scripts/transform/transform_cda.ts` -> `.resonance/artifacts/*-enriched.json`.
- **Ingestion:** `scripts/pipeline/ingest.ts`.
- **Domain:** `persona`.

### 2. EXPERIENCE Pipeline (The Bifurcated Ingestion)
The Experience pipeline is split into two layers to support the "Hot/Cold" architecture:

#### Layer A: The "Hot Path" (Structure)
- **Script:** `scripts/pipeline/ingest_experience_graph.ts`
- **Domain:** `resonance`
- **Role:** Structural telemetry. Connects `debrief` nodes to `persona` directives.
- **Vectors:** NO. Fast, cheap, structural.

#### Layer B: The "Cold Path" (Knowledge)
- **Script:** `scripts/pipeline/ingest.ts`
- **Domain:** `knowledge`
- **Role:** Semantic search. Chunks content and generates embeddings.
- **Vectors:** YES. Expensive, rich, searchable.
